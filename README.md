# Don't miss your train:
Hello and welcome to Don’t Miss Ya Train! Don’t miss your train was created to help people new to the city, and those who commute on the subway system to navigate the MTA’s delays. This app was created using a fullstack Ruby on rails implementing the MVC system. MTA data was gained using a web scraper integrating jQuery and the nokogiri parsing gem as well as the NYC opendata api. 

# Looking forward:
* I intend to optomize this for a mobile device
